# Computer-Vision

Implement different kinds of computer vision algorithms, including:

1. Low level feature detection (Harris) & Edge detection with non-maximal suppression to make lines thiner

2. Camera calibration : infer camera's internal & external parameters using optimization algorithm
   Homography : Change two movie poster on the road with homography transform
   
3. Image segmentation: implement K-means clustering & Mean shift to segment images

4. Object detection : Using Ransac to fit translational model between SIFT features

5. Guided Filter : Implementation of Microsoft's 2011 paper "Guided Image Filtering" by Kaiming He
